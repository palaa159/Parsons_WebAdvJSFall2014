<h1 id="contributing-to-apache-cordova">Contributing to Apache Cordova</h1>
<p>Anyone can contribute to Cordova. And we need your contributions.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs, improve the docs, and
contribute code.</p>
<p>For instructions on this, start with the 
<a href="http://cordova.apache.org/#contribute">contribution overview</a>.</p>
<p>The details are explained there, but the important items are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign and submit an Apache ICLA (Contributor License Agreement).</li>
<li>Have a Jira issue open that corresponds to your contribution.</li>
<li>Run the tests so your patch doesn&#39;t break existing functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to your contributions!</p>
